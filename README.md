Pawn port for DSO Nano
======================

Some initial work towards a port to the DSO Nano.

For the moment this is highly experimental and does not even boot
on the DSO Nano.


Pawn for DSO Quad
=================

Pawn scripting language for the DSO Quad pocket oscilloscope.
This is intended to make programming for DSO Quad easier and to allow tens of programs to reside on the flash drive.

It offers a comprehensive set of [libraries](https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/QuadPawn/tree/master/Compiler/include),
intuitive program selector and basic debugging facilities.

Read the [Getting started](https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/QuadPawn/wiki/Getting-started) guide, or just download
[the runtime](https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/QuadPawn/downloads) and [some apps](https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/QuadPawn/wiki).
